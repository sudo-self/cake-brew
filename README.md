### The Homebrew GUI App for OS X
Cakebrew is the most convenient way to use Homebrew for your daily tasks! It does for Homebrew what Synaptics does to Linux package managers. From the Cakebrew UI, you can:

Search for formulae
Install, uninstall and upgrade formulae
Tap and untap repos
Update Homebrew
Run the brew cleanup tool
Cakebrew was based on a project by vincentsaluzzo. Although most of the original code has already been modified, his project was the kickstart for what would become Cakebrew, and his commits are still in the working tree.
